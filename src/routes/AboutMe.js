                <p>I am majoring in computer science at Baker College with a concentration in computer programming. My interest in computers and coding started in my early adolescence, when I spent countless hours learning to make basic webpages with HTML and CSS on Neopets. </p>
                <p>I have professional experience in software engineering, data analytics and visualization, and the banking/finance industry. I also spent several years working in customer service roles, which were crucial in the development of my communication and teamwork skills.</p>
                <p>In my free time I like to study Japanese, lift weights, play cozy games, and read (biographies and self-improvement are my favorite genres). I also have a spicy miniature schnauzer mix who loves going for car rides.</p>
                <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
